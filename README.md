This repository contains java games for Symbian OS.
# How to play the games?
First, move the games onto an SD card. Insert the SD card with the games into your Nokia phone. Go to `menu`, then `applications`. You should see `SD Card` and some other folders. If you don't, there should be an `Extras` option in the `applications` menu, which you need to click. Then go to `SD Card`, and in there the directory you put the games in. Now just launch them and you can play them. If you want to, you can copy the files to the Nokia phone's internal storage.
