# SymbianOS Games
This repository contains games for Symbian OS, which old Nokia phones used.
# How to play the games?
First, move the games onto an SD card. Insert the SD card with the games into your Nokia phone. Then open the SD card on the Nokia phone, then go to applications. You should see SD card, and other files. If you don't, there should be 'Extras' button, which you need to click. Then go to 'SD Card', and in there the directory you put the games in. Now just launch them and you can play them.
